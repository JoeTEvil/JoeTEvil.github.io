<p>50 years ago, American Broadcasting Company surprised his viewers with a new TV Show. On January 12, 1966, was aired the first episode of one of the most kitsch and funniest depictions of Bob Kane's dark avenger: Batman. Instead of a crime series, the show was a bizarre comedy, whose characters took the most absurd and exaggerated situations with extreme seriousness, playing them for laughs.</p>
<p>It was absolute psychedelia, an acid-induced trance from an alternate universe where the dynamic duo of caped crusaders performed the Bat-Dance surrounded by beautiful girls dressed in above-the-knees-with-flowers skirts on colourful and pop decorated Night Clubs. But it was fun to watch, it's theme music pure genius, and the Batmobile, one of the most iconic cars constructed ever.</p>
<p>And 30 years ago, Gary Stern founded Stern Pinball Inc., the last remaining giant of the pinball manufacturing industry. So, to celebrate this double commemorative date, Stern's 30th year in business and Batman TV series 50th anniversary, they've developed Batman 66, an exquisite work of technicolour art disguised as a pinball machine. It's a Geek's dream come true, and it comes in three different flavours!</p>
<p>Its gameplay is fast-paced action, with diverse game modes where Batman and Robin need to discover the super villain plots and deduce clues so they can thwart their evil plans and capture them. And as a bonus, players are guided through the game by the voices of none other than Adam West and Burt Ward, the original Batman and Robin.</p>
<p>The machine features two full-color high definition displays, one that replaces the traditional dot matrix display, and the other one on the playfield, as part of an interactive game feature. In conjunction with Sternâ€™s new SPIKE-2 electronic pinball platform, they enable high definition graphics  and innovative animations, featuring actual footage from the TV Show.</p>
